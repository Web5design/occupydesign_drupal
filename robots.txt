# you save bandwidth and server resources.

### Giving robot access to Tamiment Library, New York University 
### (a special collection documenting labor and progressive social activity)
### However, the main access that they get will be to crawl pages that they will be
### locked out of anyway, because their robot will not be logged in. 
### We will alter this file and see if this helps them with their archving. 
### If not, we'll remove this line.
